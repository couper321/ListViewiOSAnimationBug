# ListViewiOSAnimationBug
Project to showcase a weird animation bug in Xamarin.Forms iOS listview when scrolling with images on buttons.

Providing you have installed Visual Studio 2017, and have a Remote Mac setup to work on, this project in theory should just simply build and run on a sim.

Xamarin Version 2.4.0.282
